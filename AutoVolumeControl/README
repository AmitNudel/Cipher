About the project - 
-----------------
I found that listening to sound can be quite of a task for me. Playting with the volume started to fill a bit time consuming.
I wanted to create a program that will be smart enough to control the sound automatically, so I'll be free to do other tasks. 
The program knows how to recieve audio, check it's amplitude and level it to the user's profile. I learned how to connec and
use ALSA and modify the master audio output. 

Features:
--------
* Setting master volume
* Get amplitude level
* Checking if headphones connection
* User sound profiling  
* Feautre users info can be uploaded to hash for fast searching

Future updates:
--------------
* Adding watchdog
* On a seperate thread, the program will run an amplitude check, and update the volume accordingly
* Bug logger
* User input will be kept in a file, so the user won't need to do the profiling process every time, but will be able to update 
  it, or create a seperate profile for another user.
* Running the program in the background, and giving an exit option to the user
